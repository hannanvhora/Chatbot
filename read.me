## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Financial-ChatBot.git
   cd Financial-ChatBot
   ```

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🚀 Usage

1. Start the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Open in your browser:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000
   ```

3. Upload your financial dataset (`.csv`).
4. Interact with the chatbot via the web interface.

## 🧩 Example Workflow

1. Upload a CSV containing financial records (e.g., stock prices, transactions, or budget data).
2. The system parses the data and stores it for session-based queries.
3. Ask the chatbot questions like:
   - “What is the average revenue in Q1?”
   - “Show me the highest expense in July.”
   - “Summarize profit vs expenses.”
4. The chatbot processes the query, runs analysis, and responds with insights.
